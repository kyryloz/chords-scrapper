{"id":18,"performerName":"Metallica","title":"And Justice For All Intro","lyrics":" \n\n\n Back for more (trying to keep vintage Metallica alive)!  This time \n around, we`ll learn the mellow intro to Justice for All.  Again, \n all notes have equal value (including the triplets, which are to be\n combined into one count or unit):\n \n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n ----------/-t------------------------/-t------------------------3---\n 6-7-9---7-6-7-6-4-5-5-4-7-4-2-3-5---3-2-3-2-0-2-2-0-2-0-0-2-2-0-2---2-\n 7-----7---------5-----5---5-3-----3---------2-----2---2-1-----1-----4-\n 0---------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n On the more-than-one-string parts (like the first 0-7-6), don`t strike\n  them simutaneously, but glide across them, treating the initial 0-7 \n as sustained grace notes.  I know there`s a term for this (gliss?), but \n I`m not sure what it is.  Anywayz, comments are appriciated.  \n \n Keep on pick`n,\n \n Glenn Lane: h2xs@csdnov3.unb.ca\n \n\n "}
