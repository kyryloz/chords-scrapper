Repeat This rythmn figure until\r\n you hit the bridge to the chorus. The Bridge into the chorus has a bunch of\r\n power chords which are held. Listen to the tune and you`ll get the picture.... \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  Chorus (Lyrics go `HELPLESS....!`)\r\n \r\n    Part 1                            Part 2             Part 3\r\n    A                      repeat 3x| A         G      | A         G   A\r\n e-----------------------------------\r\n B-----------------------------------\r\n G---------------------*------*------\r\n D-------7p5---------5-*5-5-5-*5-5-7-\r\n A-----------7-6-7-6----5-5-5--5-5-7-\r\n E|--5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5----------------|-5-5-5-5-5-3-3-3--|-5-5-5-5-5-3-3-5-\r\n \r\n \r\n By this I mean play Part 1 three times, then play Part 2. Then you play Part 1\r\n three times again and finish the chorus with Part 3. Work with me on this \r\n one... I`m not sure about the part 1 section... but this is close....\r\n \r\n Now return to ryth. Fig 1 amd play it till you hit the chorus a second \r\n time... do the chorus again and then play rythmn Fig 1 again until you hit the\r\n little Newstead bass solo, after which you hit a second bridge. I prefer to\r\n enter into this section with a jumping, banging pick slide. In other words I \r\n bounce the pick off the low E, A and D while sliding the edge down the \r\n fretboard... Anyway it sounds real cool...\r\n \r\n Bridge 2\r\n \r\n \r\n  | "}
