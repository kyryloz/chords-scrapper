It was only recorded once,\n at a demo session that was recorded at the same time (not sure if it was the\n same session or just one close to the same time) as the original `Killing Time`\n and `Let It Loose` and I think the original `Hit the Lights` - (the one on Metal\n Massacre) were recorded. It is only available on a couple of bootlegs. The\n Diamond Head version is available on their `White Album` and `Lightning to the\n Nations` along with the `Am I Evil` single, and probably other albums and\n singles. Both versions of this song just rule. The music here is what I heard\n and figured out listening to the Diamond Head version, because I don`t own a\n copy of the Metallica version. This is probably how Metallica plays it also.\n I only figured out the main riff. If i ever find music for this or figure out\n other parts of the song, I will post them. Well..enough of the typing. Here`s\n the song.\n \n Tabbed by Paul Halvorson\n \n \n                                               Repeat a whole bunch of times.\n \n P.M -----|             P.M. -------|          P.M. -----------|\n --------------------------------------------------||\n --------------------------------------------------||\n ||*----------------------------------------------------------------------*||\n ||*----------------------------------------------------------------------*||\n |-10--7---------------------5h7------------------------5h7----||\n ||---0--0----------------------0--0--------------------0--5--7------------||\n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n \n ===============================================================================\n ==                           TABLATURE ЕХРLАNАТIОN                           ==\n ===============================================================================\n \n ----------                            ----------\n ----5h8--- Hammeron                   ----(8)--- Ghost Note\n ----------                            ----------\n ----5p8--- Pulloff                    ----------\n \n ----------                            ----------\n ----5/8--- Slide Up                   -----x---- Dead Note\n ----------                            ----------\n ----58--- Slide Down                 ----------\n \n ----------                            ||------|| Repeat Start & End\n ----5~~~-- Vibrato                    ||*----*||\n ----------                            ||*----*||\n ----------                            ||------||\n \n Rhythm:\n   w = whole note            W = dotted whole\n   h = half note             H = dotted half\n   q = quarter note          Q = dotted quarter\n   e = eighth note           E = dotted eighth\n   s = sixteenth note        S = dotted sixteenth\n   ^ = triplet\n \n ===============================================================================\n ==           Created with a shareware version of the BUCKET `О TAB           ==\n ==                  tablature creation software for Windows                  ==\n ==                           For more information:                           ==\n ==                         email: gse@ocsystems.com                          ==\n ==     US Mail: The Bucket, 3176-B5 Summit Square Dr., Оактоn, VA 22124      ==\n ===============================================================================\n    \n \n \n\n "}
